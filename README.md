# Hej

Hej is like Yo but the color orange. You can add friends, send them a "Hej!" notification, and they can send one back.

Hej is my first android app, which I am releasing
in the hopes that it may help someone get an idea
for how to make thier own app or see how easy it is.

Issues: 
  - Code could be cleaned up. This was my first app and so it didn't evolve well.
  - The UI is not well done, becasue I didn't give the UI much thought. 
  - The handeling of passwords is shameful. I tried to get the security right when sending it 
    across the network, but I do not know for sure if it has been done correctly.
